Interactive Full-Stack Project
Projects play a key role in your journey to becoming a full-stack web developer. As you enter the last phase of the boot camp, you’ll begin to apply for development jobs. If you want to land interviews, your portfolio must feature high-quality deployed examples of your work—and you can use your finished projects for that very purpose.

As your first opportunity to show employers your collaborative skills and coding abilities, this particular project will be a focal point of your portfolio. Employers want to see what you can do, but they also want to see how you work with other developers. The more examples of deployed collaborative work you have in your portfolio, the more likely you are to get an interview and a job. That’s why one of the requirements for this project is that you add it to your portfolio.

Project Requirements
You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six weeks to create a real-world full-stack application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfil the following requirements:

Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.

Use Handlebars.js as the templating engine.

Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.

Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we haven’t discussed.

Have a polished UI.

Be responsive.

Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.

Include authentication (express-session and cookies).

Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.

Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

Finally, you must add your project to the portfolio that you created in Module 2.

Presentation Requirements
Use this Project Presentation Template Links to an external site.to address the following:

Elevator pitch: A one-minute description of your application.

Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?

Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?

Demo: Show your stuff!

Directions for future development.

Links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository.

Grading Requirements
This project is graded based on the following criteria:
